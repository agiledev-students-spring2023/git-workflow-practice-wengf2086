### What is interesting about this article?
<p>This article discusses the possibility of ChatGPT replacing Google's search engine. It's something that I never thought about, but after reading this article I can definitely see that ChatGPT could be a viable (and in some cases, even better) alternative of Google, with a few changes. I'm interested to see how Google will respond to ChatGPT and if they will be able to compete and maintain their position in this field. It's also pretty funny that ChatGPT itself says that it's not intended to replcae Google's search engine. I guess we'll see in the coming years what will happen, but as someone who aspires to work at Google in the future, I am personally hoping for Google to come up with something even more amazing than the already revolutionary ChatGPT.

## Comment
**Comment from Charlotte Lin (cxl229):** This is a really fascinating article, especially with the buzz around ChatGPT these days. At this point, everyone is just speculating where this technology will go and how important it will become in our day-to-day lives. The article's discussion of how Google makes its money from its search engine ad revenue is interesting to me, because not only does Google show sponsored content "next to the search results" as the article mentions, but they also push sponsored search results to the top of the page, so that people are more likely to click on it. In the case that ChatGPT *does* replace Google's search engine...I wonder if they will do the same thing with advertising? That might lead to people getting biased information, because the AI would respond based on who's paying them, rather than what's actually the most useful or correct. This presents an interesting new problem, especially if the AI only gives that one response, and the user trusts the AI enough to just accept it as the truth.
