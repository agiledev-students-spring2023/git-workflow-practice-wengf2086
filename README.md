### What is interesting about this article?
<p>This article discusses the possibility of ChatGPT replacing Google's search engine. It's something that I never thought about, but after reading this article I can definitely see that ChatGPT could be a viable (and in some cases, even better) alternative of Google, with a few changes. I'm interested to see how Google will respond to ChatGPT and if they will be able to compete and maintain their position in this field. It's also pretty funny that ChatGPT itself says that it's not intended to replcae Google's search engine. I guess we'll see in the coming years what will happen, but as someone who aspires to work at Google in the future, I am personally hoping for Google to come up with something even more amazing than the already revolutionary ChatGPT.

## Comment
**Comment from Charlotte Lin (cxl229):** This is a really fascinating article, especially with the buzz around ChatGPT these days. At this point, everyone is just speculating where this technology will go and how important it will become in our day-to-day lives. The article's discussion of how Google makes its money from its search engine ad revenue is interesting to me, because not only does Google show sponsored content "next to the search results" as the article mentions, but they also push sponsored search results to the top of the page, so that people are more likely to click on it. In the case that ChatGPT *does* replace Google's search engine...I wonder if they will do the same thing with advertising? That might lead to people getting biased information, because the AI would respond based on who's paying them, rather than what's actually the most useful or correct. This presents an interesting new problem, especially if the AI only gives that one response, and the user trusts the AI enough to just accept it as the truth.

<p>I found this article interesting since I had the same thoughts when ChatGPT was first released. It is esentially google but rather than having to go through all the links yourself, this AI software presents you with its "best" compiled answer. Granted, in situations where the search is more abstract, I feel like this would also introduce the potential issue of how do you find a better suited answer for your individualized needs, since part of the benefit of Googling and having that list of optional links is that you're able to select the best response for your specific senario. Though, with that said, in terms of finding direct answers, I do think most would opt for the efficiency of ChatGPT over Google.

**Comment from Jeffrey Chen (jc9964):**
I think ChatGBT vs Google is certainly an interesting topic of debate.  The article does touch on the subject about search functionality of ChatGBT and how it gives human readable responses, but it takes time for ChatGBT to generate its responses and its not a reliable service (no sources cited) as of yet.  Google in comparsion outsources its information and we can pick and choose (links) which ones to believe as well as check the credibility and sources it comes from.  I think in the future when ChatGBT becomes refined enough, it could possibly overtake Google.  But I can't confidently say that at that point if Google will become irrelevant or improve and pass ChatGBT.  Reminds me a bit of the Intel vs AMD debate where AMD became a valid competetor in the CPU market by pursuing the trend of affordable multi-core processors but was trumped by Intel by most metrics and benchmarks.

**Comment from mhw370 Mindy:**
I think the comments made by Paul Buchheit, the creator of Gmail, regarding the potential of conversational AI models like ChatGPT to disrupt Google's business model, both intriguing and thought-provoking. While it's true that AI models like GPT-3 have shown remarkable progress in natural language processing and have the potential to change the way we consume information, predicting their ability to displace a giant like Google in just two years seems premature. It's more likely that AI will complement Google's existing products and services, rather than replace them. Nevertheless, it's an exciting time to witness the rapid development and integration of AI into our daily lives, and it will be fascinating to see how it shapes the future of the tech industry. Moreover, Google is already incorporating AI into its products and services, like Google Assistant and Google Translate. These AI-powered tools enhance user experience and provide more personalized and accurate results. AI will likely continue to complement Google's existing offerings, making them even more efficient and effective.
